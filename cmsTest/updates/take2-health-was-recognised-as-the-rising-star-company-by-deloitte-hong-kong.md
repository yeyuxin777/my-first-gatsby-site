Take2 Health was honoured to be named the Rising Star Company in the 2021 Deloitte Hong Kong Technology Fast 20 program on Dec 15, 2021.

The 2021 Hong Kong Rising Star award acknowledges the outstanding performances of impactful start-ups with leading technologies and enormous growth potential in its industry. Thank you, Deloitte, for recognising our relentless pursuit of promoting early nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) detection through the use of ground-breaking technologies combining PCR and NGS (Next-generation Sequencing), and with the mission to guard the health of everyone. In the past year, we had successfully collaborated with numerous clinics & hospitals in Hong Kong to provide comprehensive coverage of our test within the territory.

At present, we are committed to building a digitalised platform to enable the community's easy access to our comprehensive medical solutions. So once again, a huge thank you to Deloitte, and we will keep up the good work.
