Take2 Health (“Take2”) and Global Medical Technologies (“GMT”) collaborate on the distribution of the Take2 Prophecy™ Test for Nasopharyngeal Cancer (“NPC”) in the Philippines. 

GMT is a local medical distribution group that aids doctors in finding the root cause of diseases through scientific knowledge by introducing advanced diagnostic services from overseas to Filipinos. The services that GMT provides target a variety of indications, such as oncology, nutrition, internal medicine, and dermatology. 

With GMT’s extensive local healthcare network, the partnership is expected to signify an in-depth exploration of the local market, and allow the Take2 Prophecy™ Test for NPC to become accessible to most major cities in this region with high NPC incidence rate.
