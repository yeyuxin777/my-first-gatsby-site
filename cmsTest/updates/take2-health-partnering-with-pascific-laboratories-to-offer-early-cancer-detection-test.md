Take2 Health (“Take2”) and Pascific Laboratories are working together to offer the Take2 Prophecy™ Test for Nasopharyngeal Cancer (“NPC”) in the Philippines, as the first step of rolling out the operation.

Pascific Laboratories is a healthcare group focusing on improving access to precision healthcare with operations across the Philippines, Singapore, and India. Take2 is honoured to work alongside the distinguished team of researchers and clinicians at Pascific Laboratories who share the same vision with us.

The age-specific NPC incidence rate in the Philippines ranks 7th among all Asian countries\[1\]. By joining hands, it is expected to raise the awareness of early NPC detection and improve the overall health of the local communities through enabling in-time diagnosis and treatment in place.
