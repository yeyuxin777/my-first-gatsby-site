From 1 October 2021 onwards, KPMG employees could choose the Take2 Prophecy™ Test for Nasopharyngeal Cancer and be eligible for reimbursement under their employees’ medical check-up benefit.

This collaboration not only shows the multination corporations’ recognition for innovative medical technologies, but also stresses the emphasis on employees’ health, as well as the importance of early cancer detection.

In recent years, more and more businesses are creating considerate working environments and offering thoughtful benefits to attract talents, including providing a comprehensive medical check-up for employees and their families, as well as other health management related welfare. Take2 Health is pleased to work with businesses and to contribute to fulfilling employee’s needs by means of including early cancer detection in employee benefit schemes and raising awareness towards the importance of preventive healthcare.
