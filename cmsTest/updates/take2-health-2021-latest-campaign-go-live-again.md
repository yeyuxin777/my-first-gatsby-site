title: Take2 Health 2021 Latest Campaign - Go Live Again
detail: Mr. Cheung Tat-ming, a Nasopharyngeal Cancer (NPC) survivor, had experienced
  a delay in seeking medical intervention because of lacking cancer awareness, and
  hence he overlooked the warning signs of his health. Through his story, he is sharing
  with everyone his thoughts on the importance of detecting cancer early. According
  to the World Health Organization statistics of 2018, the NPC incidence rate in Hong
  Kong is 5 to 6 times the worldâ€™s average1,2. We should all be reminded not to overlook
  the risk of NPC. It can strike anyone at any age. Therefore, everyone must be vigilant
  to NPC and consider taking the early NPC detection test as a precaution.
