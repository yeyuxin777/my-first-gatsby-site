Take2 Health (“Take2”) and Pantai Premier Pathology joined hands to offer the Take2 Prophecy™ Test for Nasopharyngeal Cancer (“NPC”) in Malaysia, aiming to identify early-stage NPC patients and thereby enable timely diagnosis and treatments for patients in Malaysia.

Pantai Premier Pathology is a medical laboratory offering a comprehensive range of laboratory services under IHH Healthcare, one of the world’s top 10 healthcare groups by market capitalisation. This collaboration is a significant milestone in early cancer detection in Southeast Asia and also the first step of Take2 to advocate the broader use of innovative biotechnology in Malaysia. 

NPC is vastly common among Southeast Asian countries, ranking 5th in terms of cancer incidence, with over 2,000 new cases reported in Malaysia in 2018\[1\]. Leveraging the cutting-edge Next- generation Sequencing technology, together with the local medical network of Pantai Premier Pathology, Take2 is confident to work with Malaysia’s clinicians to foster better clinical outcomes and patient experience in the battles against cancers.
