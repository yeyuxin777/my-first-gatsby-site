Starting from November 2020, the Take2 Prophecy™ Test for Nasopharyngeal Cancer and other health assessment services officially joined the CXA’s wellness provider network, providing the innovative medical solution to Hong Kong users.

Established in 2013, CXA Group has gradually become Asia’s largest and most widely adopted employee benefits platform. Its clients include world-renowned brands Starbucks, L'Oréal Group and so on. Currently, eligible employees could redeem the complimentary test with their welfare credits through the platform. Through the collaboration, Take2 Health and CXA jointly create a healthier and stronger team of talents for the business, and set the basis to encourage the public to include early cancer detection test as part of medical check-ups.
